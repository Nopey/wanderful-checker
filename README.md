# Wanderful Syntax Checker
`wanderful` is a toy scripting language invented [by David Wessels for his Compilers course](http://csci.viu.ca/~wesselsd/courses/csci435/labs/overview.html);
I wrote this syntax checker as a part of said course.

See also, [the test suite](https://github.com/Nopey/wanderful-tests) I wrote.
